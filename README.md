# PlaneGame-OpenGL
**CSCI 155 Final Project** <br>

Julia Hsing & Megan Chen <br>

For our final project, we plan to create a single-player, third-person minigame. The user will be able to move a bird (the main character of our game) up, down, left, and right using their WASD or arrow keys. There will be pellets of food floating in the sky, and the goal of the game is to eat as many pellets as possible, without "dying" (crashing into buildings, hitting the floor, etc.). We plan to develop the game using C++ and OpenGL. Our project will involve object rendering, shadows, and interactive user controls, which are all related to computer graphics in video games. We will be implementing the game in a 3D space, and we will need to render the bird, food pellets, and buildings. Understanding class-related concepts like rendering and interpolation will be important for creating appealing game scenes, and ensuring that our animations are smooth and seamless. <br>

Our project draws inspiration from a 3D Plane Game that we found online (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1Fa8N1fklI). For the Final Project Code Checkpoint, our code is fairly similar to that of the 3D Plane Game because we primarily worked on understanding the sample code and figuring out how to run it.
